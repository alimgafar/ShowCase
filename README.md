#ShowCase

ShowCase is built on the MeteorJS platform to catalog sites running on MeteorJS.
Included here are versions build with the Blaze and REACT front ends. There are
also versions built with GraphQL and Apollo. It will be tested on AWS, Galaxy,
Heroku, and DigitalOcean.

Consider this template:
  * https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-agency: Keep hero, portfolio, contact, portfolio modal. Add carousel to hero, three small photos under the main photo in portfolio modal, link to site on portfolio modal.
